## <a name="family-introduction"></a>Family Introduction

Directly from [Malpedia](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.bumblebee):

> This malware is delivered by an ISO file, with an DLL inside with a custom loader. Because of the unique user-agent "bumblebee" this malware was dubbed BUMBLEBEE. At the time of Analysis by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) BumbleBee was observed to fetch Cobalt Strike Payloads.

## <a name="fast-unpacking"></a>Unpacking - Heroes Sometimes Wear CAPEv2

The given sample is a DLL, compiled on May 18, 2023 and has 5 exports. Besides the entry point, `DllEntryPoint`, all other exports have weird names which are indicators of obfuscation.

![Basic Information](assets/images/basic_info.jpg "Basic Information")

I found the code in `DllEntryPoint` to be harmless. Of the 4 weird exports, `JDuCS622tuL6`, `MkcDIl34k3Si`, `PcYge9j` accepted function arguments while `eOXScagadNKe` did not. Using cross-references in IDA, I found that the other 3 exports were called at some point within the DLL while `eOXScagadNKe` was not. That was my cue that `eOXScagadNKe` might be the real entry point.

![Exports](assets/images/exports.jpg "Exports")

Keeping in mind some Bumblebee-related blog posts that I had read, my assumption was that the code inside `eOXScagadNKe` was obfuscated/packed. So, my next step was to unpack the sample. My go-to automated unpackers are either [UnpacMe](https://www.unpac.me/#/) or [CAPEv2](https://capesandbox.com/). Since we're dealing with a 64-bit DLL with a custom export as entry point, my choice was CAPEv2. AFAIK, UnpacMe cannot handle 64-bit DLLs with custom entry point.

I submitted a CAPEv2 analysis with two options: `dll` analysis package and custom entry point function, `eOXScagadNKe`. The task is available [here](https://capesandbox.com/analysis/391337/).

The analysis extracted 4 payloads. Basic information for each is listed below:

The first sample triggered the `Payload` rule, so I picked that up for further analysis. That's our unpacked C++ (see `RTTI` string in functions list) Bumblebee payload. It was compiled on March 6, 2023.

The other two DLL payloads (`c3afa8997e5ddc6ce8aac2302886402a0add243b2169d31a37dceae3d6419c19` and `f48f87325c21cfb7ba47157d5b3cf196e47450202b9b7a87c8b5b4514f91226e`) have internal filenames, `RapportGP.dll`. These are described very well in [The chronicles of Bumblebee: The Hook, the Bee, and the Trickbot connection](https://elis531989.medium.com/the-chronicles-of-bumblebee-the-hook-the-bee-and-the-trickbot-connection-686379311056)

### <a name="thread-exec-hijack"></a>Thread Execution Hijacking

The `DllMain` function in the payload started off with a bang! An undocumented function, `NtCreateThreadEx` is used to spawn a hidden thread in suspended state with a decoy start address; in this case, `RtlNewSecurityObjectWithMultipleInheritance`. The start address is modified to the true address and the thread is resumed.

### <a name="c2-decrypt"></a>RC4 Decryption of C2

Soon after the thread starts, the C2 configuration is decrypted via RC4 with a hardcoded key, `JSfuURMASs`.

![C2 Decryption](assets/images/c2_decrypt.png "C2 Decryption")

The [configuration extraction script](assets/scripts/bumblebee_config_extract.py) is mostly taken from [BumbleBee notes](https://blog.krakz.fr/articles/bumblebee/). My only addition is the code to extract the campaign ID (in this case, `mc1905`).

The configuration script is known to work on atleast 4 payloads:
